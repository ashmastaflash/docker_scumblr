# Scumblr with Docker

This repo contains everything you need to deploy a basic instance of Scumblr (https://github.com/netflix/scumblr). Scumblr is a Netflix open source project that allows performing periodic searches and storing / taking actions on the identified results.

**Please Note: Deploying this container as-is will provide a working Scumblr instance with an onboard SQLite database. This means that all data will be lost when the container terminates. See the configuration section below for additional setup information.**

**If you just want to quickly test the application, start with the deployment section below.**

## Configuration

This section discusses required/optional configuration that can be done prior to deploying Scumblr. Configuration is broken up into the following sections:

* API Keys (required for most Search providers to work)
* Admin User (Setup admin credentials)
* Database (Use a persistent database instead of the default ephemeral SQLite db)
* SSL

### API Keys

Scumblr requires API keys to function. These can be setup in the config/scumblr/scumblr.rb file. Templates are contained in the file. By default these can be set using environment vairables (see Environment Variables below)

### Admin User

The default configuration will create the following admin user:

``admin@admin.admin:password``

These credentials can be set on line 2 the config/scumblr/seeds.rb file. Note: There three fields that need to be changed: email, password, and password_confirmation. Changing the line to the following would set the account email to new_email@admin.admin with a password of "new_password":

``User.create(:email=>"new_email@admin.admin", :password=>"new_password", :password_confirmation=>"new_password", :admin=>true)``

### Database

The default database will be an onboard SQLite db. This will work for testing but will be lost if the container terminates. To configure a permanent database, setup the database.yml file in config/scumblr/database.yml or use the environment variable (see Environment Variables below). For more information on the database.yml file see http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database.

### SSL

This docker container ships with a self-signed cert to be used for SSL. To use a custom key pair/certificate replace the server.key and server.crt files in config/nginx

### Environment Variables

The following are environment variables available to configure scumblr:
```
SCUMBLR_HOST # Default hostname for scumblr (used for email notifications, etc.) i.e. "scumblr.com"
SCUMBLR_PROTOCOL # Default protocol i.e. "https"

SCUMBLR_CREATE_DB # Run rake db:create if true. For initial DB setup.
SCUMBLR_LOAD_SCHEMA # Run rake db:schema:load. For initial DB setup. Will reset DB to default!
SCUMBLR_RUN_MIGRATIONS # Run rake db:migrate if true. Will update database with migrations if included.
SCUMBLR_SEED_STATUSES # Create a default set of statuses if set to "true"
SCUMBLR_SEED_ADMIN # Create an admin user (admin@admin.admin/password) if no users exist and SEED_ADMIN set to "true"

SKETCHY_PORT_443_TCP_ADDR
SKETCHY_PORT_443_TCP_PORT
SKETCHY_USE_SSL
SKETCHY_VERIFY_SSL
SKETCHY_ACCESS_TOKEN
SKETCHY_TAG_STATUS_CODE

RAILS_ENV # Select a rails environment (devlopment, staging, produdction)
DATABASE_URL # Configure a database URL (ex: sqlite3:///db/production.sqlite)

``git clone https://github.com/ahoernecke/docker_scumblr``
``cd docker_scumblr``

* Build the docker image

``docker build -t "scumblr" . ``

* Run the container either:
